# Manipulation-of-Text-URL-Dataset-and-Feature Engineering
The repository holds the techniques to manipulate text to numerical data for analysis without the use of Natural Language Processing <br>
# AIM OF THE PROJECT-> 
This project focuses on converting a URL dataset into a numeric dataset with 24 parameters that can be used for machine learning applications. The primary goal is to extract meaningful features from URLs to aid in classifying them as benign, phishing, malware, or defacement. The project uses various libraries and techniques for feature engineering and visualization. <br>
# WHAT IS DONE IN IT ->
-> Project Structure <br>
->Loading and Preprocessing Data <br>
->Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>
->Visualizing Word Clouds for different URL types <br>
->Feature Engineering <br>
# Extracting 24 numeric features from URLs <br>
# FINAL OUTCOME -> Features Extracted
-> use_of_ip: Indicates if the URL contains an IP address.
->abnormal_url: Checks for abnormal URLs.
->google_index: Checks if the URL is indexed by Google.
->count.: Counts the number of dots in the URL. <br>
->count-www: Counts the occurrences of 'www' in the URL. <br>
->count@: Counts the occurrences of '@' in the URL. <br>
->count_dir: Counts the number of directories in the URL path. <br>
->count_embed_domian: Counts the number of embedded domains. <br>
->short_url: Indicates if a shortening service is used. <br>
->count-https: Counts the occurrences of 'https' in the URL. <br>
->count-http: Counts the occurrences of 'http' in the URL. <br>
->count%: Counts the occurrences of '%' in the URL. <br>
->count?: Counts the '? occurrences in the URL. <br>
->count-: Counts the occurrences of '-' in the URL. <br>
->count=: Counts the occurrences of '=' in the URL. <br>
->url_length: Measures the length of the URL. <br>
->hostname_length: Measures the length of the hostname. <br>
->sus_url: Indicates if suspicious words are present in the URL. <br>
->count-digits: Counts the number of digits in the URL. <br>
->count-letters: Counts the number of letters in the URL. <br>
->fd_length: Measures the length of the first directory in the URL path. <br>
->tld_length: Measures the length of the top-level domain. <br>
-> label: The target variable indicates the type of URL (benign, phishing, malware, defacement). <br>
# FINAL OUTCOME -> 24 Features Extracted

The manipulated data can't be uploaded because of its large size ...access to it can be requested through my email address -> bassisaksham2003@gmail.com <br>
It is an extensive data set of about 651191 URLs divided into 4 categories 'phishing', 'benign', 'defacement', 'malware' and 'short_url' <br>
